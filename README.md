## Hello, world! 👋

I am currently a master's student at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, studying for the Business: Data, Insights, and Analytics degree. I have a Bachelor of Science in Computer Information Systems from Missouri State University and almost ten years of experience working in software quality assurance automation. I plan on adding examples of my analytics work here - expect to see plenty of SQL, Python, and Excel. Thank you for taking a look!
